An interactive 3D simulation of our solar system with realistic planetary motion and orbital mechanics.

**Features:**
- Fully interactive 3D environment with mouse-controlled camera (drag to orbit, scroll to zoom)
- All 8 planets plus the Sun with accurate colors and relative sizes
- Realistic orbital speeds and paths with visual orbit lines
- Click planets to view detailed information cards
- Saturn's iconic ring system rendered in 3D
- 10,000-star background for immersive space atmosphere

**Technologies:** HTML5, Three.js (WebGL), CSS3, JavaScript
